# basicCalculator
Hi, this is my first project with JavaScript.

## Updates!!
Hi again, I updated the calculator design and rewrite the JavaScript.
This new design was inspired by [Sadek Hossen Rony](https://www.figma.com/@sadekui).
You can check the design [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/984658356416751911).

I tried to reduce code repetition and make practices in Sass in this new work.
I wrote the design with Sass. 
Old JavaScript code was almost 374 lines, now it's almost 91 lines.
